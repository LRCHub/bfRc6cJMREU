Say you doubt if it feels right
Put it on hold when you need time
Covered all the fears
Holding on to hope
Put it on hold when you need time
But when you called
I've been wanting to say
I got all of the patience in the world
If it's not now
Or anywhere soon
I will still be around,
I'll be awake till you take me home
Don't be afraid, you won't be alone
I'll be here to stay if it all comes down
Just say you never let this go
Can't you see how I try
Wish that I could tell what you feel like
Sometimes it seems so clear
But you always disappear
Wish that I could tell what you feel like
Cause when you called
I've been wanting to say
No matter how long it takes you'll find me here
If it's not now
Or anywhere soon
I will still be around,
I'll be awake till you take me home
Don't be afraid, you won't be alone
I'll be here to stay if it all comes down
Just say you'll never let this go
Never, never let this go
Never, never let this go
I'll be here to stay when it all comes down
Just say you'll never let this go
