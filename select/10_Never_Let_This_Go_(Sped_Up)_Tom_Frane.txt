Say you doubt if it feels right
Put it on hold when you need time
Covered all the fears
Holding onto hope
Put it on hold when you need time
But when you called
I've been wanting to say
I got all the patience in the world
If it's not now, or anywhere soon
I'll still be around
I'll be awake till you take me home
Don't be afraid, you won't be alone
I'll be here to stay when it all comes down
Just say you'll never let this go
Can't you see how I try?
I wish that I could tell what it feels like
Sometimes it seems clear
But you always disappear
I wish that I could tell what it feels like
But when you called
I've been wanting to say
No matter how long it takes, you'll find me here
If it's not now, or anywhere soon
I'll still be around
I'll be awake till you take me home
Don't be afraid, you won't be alone
I'll be here to stay when it all comes down
Just say you'll never let this go
I'll be here to stay when it all comes down
Just say you'll never let this go (never never let this go)
(I'll be here to stay when it all comes down)
